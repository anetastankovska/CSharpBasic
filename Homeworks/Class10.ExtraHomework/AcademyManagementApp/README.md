1. The app will have users that can log in and perform some actions. The user can choose one of the 3 roles and log in:

- Admin

- Student ( has a current Subject, and Grades )

2. After logging in there should be different options for different roles:

3. Admins can add/remove Teachers, Students, and other Admins ( can't remove itself )
4. Trainer can choose between seeing all students and all subjects
5. When choosing Students, all student names should appear
6. When chosen a name, it should print all the subjects
7. When choosing Subjects, all Subject names appear with how many students attend it next to it
8. Students are shown the name of the subject that they are listening to and a list of their grades
