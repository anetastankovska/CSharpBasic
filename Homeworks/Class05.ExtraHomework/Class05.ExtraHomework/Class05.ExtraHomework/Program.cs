//Guess the number
//Create a program(game) Guess the number. The game should be a Console application. Game rules are for limited tries to guess the number that is randomly generated between two end points.

//When the game start it should ask the user for difficulty.

//Easy
//In easy mode user should have 9 tries to guess the number between 0-100.
//Normal
//In normal mode user should have 7 tries to guess the number between 0-500.
//Hard
//In hard mode user should have 5 tries to guess the number between 0-1000.
//Every guess should give the user hint if it is close and also should display the number that the user last entered. example

//If the number that should be guessed is 10 and the user enters 18 it should print out "Your guess is far to high, number entered: 18".
//If the number that should be guessed is 10 and the user enters 2 it should print out "Your guess is far to low, number entered: 2".
//If the number that should be guessed is 10 and the user enters 7 it should print out "Your guess is a little bit lower, number entered: 7".
//If the number that should be guessed is 10 and the user enters 13 it should print out "Your guess is a little bit higher, number entered: 13".
//If the number that should be guessed is 10 and the user enters 10 it should print out "Nailed it. number entered: 10". You can add your kind of notifications if you like.
//Based on how fast the user guessed the number it should display a proper title and the number that should be guessed. example

//If user nails it on the first try it should print out "Lucky guess.".
//If user did not guess the number it should print out "Try again".
//Optional:
//Give the user a chance to restart the game(ex Press 1 to start a new game, press 2 to quit game) without starting the project from scratch.

//Tips: Try using the OOP principles that we learned so far.
